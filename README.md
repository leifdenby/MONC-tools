# Utilities for MONC

The aim of this repository is to provide tools for collaboration and research
with [ParaCon]() on work using the [MONC model]().

## State evolution plot

Utility script [state_evolution_plot.py](state_evolution_plot.py) will produce
an overview plot as below for MONC output (currently works on UCLALES output,
but with input from ParaCon collaborators this script will be updated).
